      some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,

      “I can guess the subject of your reverie.”

      “I should imagine not.”

      “You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
      evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of
      your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet
      the noise; the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all
      these people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”

      “Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
      agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great
      pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman
      can bestow.”

      Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired
      he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such
      reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

      “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”

      “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all
      astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray
      when am I to wish you joy?”

      “That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A
      lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to
      love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be
      wishing me joy.”

      “Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
      absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law,
      indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with
      you.”

      He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
      entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced
      her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.




Chapter 7

      Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of
      two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was
      entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and
      their mother’s fortune, though ample for her situation in life,
      could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been
      an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.

      She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk
      to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother
      settled in London in a respectable line of trade.

      The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
      convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually
      tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to
      their aunt and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two
      youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly
      frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than
      their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to
      Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish
      conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the
      country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
      from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both
      with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia
      regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,
      and Meryton was the headquarters.

      Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most
      interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their
      knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings
      were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the
      officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this
      opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They
      could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large
      fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was
      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an
      ensign.

      After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,
      Mr. Bennet coolly observed,

      “From all that Ican collect by your manner of talking, you must
      be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it
      some time, but I am now convinced.”

      Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with
      perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of
      Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the
      day, as he was going the next morning to London.

      “I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be
      so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think
      slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own,
      however.”

      “If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of
      it.”

      “Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”

      “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not
      agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every
      particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two
      youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.”

      “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the
      sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I
      dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.
      I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and,
      indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,
      with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I
      shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked
      very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in his
      regimentals.”

      “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and
      Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did
      when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in
      Clarke’s library.”

      Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman
      with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the
      servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with
      pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter
      read,

      “Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?
      Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”

      “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.

      “MY DEAR FRIEND,—
      “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa
      and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest
      of our lives, for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women
      can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the
      receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with
      the officers.—Yours ever,

      “CAROLINE BINGLEY”

      “With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell
      us of _that_.”

      “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”

      “Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.

      “No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems
      likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.”

      “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure
      that they would not offer to send her home.”

      “Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to
      Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”

      “I had much rather go in the coach.”
